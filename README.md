# company-custom-ribbon
Custom Microsoft Word Ribbon created for company

I originally, created this document for my employer's employees to use in Word 2007.  It has been a useful tool for pushing down Corporate-controlled reusable content and information such as logos, letterhead, Company addresses, etc., so I have adapted it for Word 2010. 

I opted to use Custom UI Editor for Microsoft Word to create the document, after attempting to do it in VB unsuccessfully for a bit. 

Resources I referenced in the design, implementation, and monitoring of this document include:

I had fun and my boss was impressed, so this project was a win! Oh yeaah!

All instances of my company's name have been changed to read CompanyName in the version available here.

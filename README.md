# company-custom-ribbon
Custom Microsoft Word Ribbon created for my company

Originally, I created this document for employees to use in Word 2007.  The interface allows for reusable content such as logos, letterhead, watermarks, etc. to be controlled and distributed by Corporate Management. I have since adapted it for Word 2010. 

The code is input into Custom UI Editor for Microsoft Word to generate the Microsoft Words Template file which is then used to replace the Users default normal.doc file.

All reusuable content called by the code had been removed from the code available here privacy reasons.
